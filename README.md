# Product Landing Page

The purpose of this exercise was to solely build a responsive website using only:
 - HTML
 - Tailwind CSS

Attempting of this exercise was smooth due to reading through the documentation at [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/ "Tailwind CSS Docs") and following the tutorial video on the Scrimba platform [Learn Tailwind CSS](https://scrimba.com/learn/tailwind "Learn Tailwind CSS on Scrimba")
